I would like to analyse our phone data our dashboard 

Here is an example of one week's worth of raw phone data

I'd like to be able to look at how many patients call the vasectomy phone line. When I look at the vasectomy phone line information, I would like to be able to see: 

Would like to know the number of phone calls taken per day and per week? I want to know the number of phone calls. The average length of phone call per day for every day and for the week. I would like to know the max waiting time per day for the week. I'd like to see percentages of phone calls taken vs. missed. And also the raw numbers of phone calls taken vs. missed as well.

•	What time they are able to call

•	The patients are calling

•	I would like to know how many of those phone calls are picked up and how many are missed

I want to know how many missed calls there are. I want to know what the max waiting time is. I'd like to know what the average waiting time is. I'd like to know what the average core length is.

I'd like a heat map of the week and then every half-hour slot showing me how many phone calls have been made in that time. For our standard operating hours.

I would like the heatmap to show to be broken down by calls in and also a separate one showing the same data via calls out.

I'd like to be able to assess each individual staff member's performance on the phone: 

•	How many phone calls are taking in

•	How many phone calls are taking out

•	What their average time to pick up is

•	And what their average length of phone call is

•	

I would like to know the average time to pick up. I would like it to be a simple week review to be seen on one page.
